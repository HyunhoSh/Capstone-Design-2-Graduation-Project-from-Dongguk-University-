## Topic: Tracking AI-based colon polyps patients' eating habits and providing solutions

## My role
1. Managing DB by using MySQL and connecting it to web server and chatbot server
2. Making chatbot code with teammate

## Why did we start this project?
1. Many patients who had colon polyps should be managed by doctors for preventing colorectal cancer.
2. In present, patients visit hospital and submit handwritten records of their diet and daily lives, but it is pretty difficult that one doctor should check many patients' records.
3. This project's goal is to use chatbot, web server and AI for managing patients' diet and daily lives for the ease of work for doctors. Thus, patients can use medical service regardless of time and place
